# rx8-arduino-hood

Source code for an implementation of rx8 navigation hood control via an arduino and converting the dashboard navigation button and audio system commands (simulating a tape/md interface for the audio system) to USB commands.
This project is then used with an arm like a raspebery pi or an odroid with a 7" screen replacing the original navigation screen of the rx8.
